# Recognition of human positions
The object of research is the methods of human pose recognition. The aim of the work is to study approaches to recognizing a person's position, to study the process of recognition on the web platform by creating a software application using TensorFlow.js. Research methods are methods of algorithm theory, methods of object-oriented programming, methods of functional programming, machine learning methods, methods of researching the effectiveness of machine learning models, the method of comparative analysis. As a result of the work, the current state of research on the topic of human pose recognition was analyzed and a method suitable for use in the web platform was chosen. The characteristics of the model when used with different parameters were investigated. The results of the study can be used in research institutions or in the development of web applications that use machine learning functions to recognize a person's position.

# Requirements
These technologies should to be used for training robots that are able to replace a person in various processes in production. Or recognition of the position should be put as a basis entertainment applications, for example, as a contactless control system in computer games.

The user must trust the program and not be afraid to use it.

The program must provide all the basic needs of the user and not implement features that are unnecessary for him.

The program should allow for changes and additions.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
